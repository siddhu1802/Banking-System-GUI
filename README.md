# Banking System GUI

A Java-based Banking System with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that manages customer accounts, bank staff, loans, and transactions. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and includes features like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and loan management.

## Features

- **Customer Management**: Create and manage different types of accounts (Current, Fixed, etc.).
- **Staff & Manager Roles**: Separate functionalities for bank staff and managers.
- **Loan Handling**: Manage loan-related operations.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Interactive GUI for smooth user experience.
- **Extensible OOP Design**: Uses classes like `Account`, `Customer`, `Loan`, `BankStaff`, and `Manager`.
